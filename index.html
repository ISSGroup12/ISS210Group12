This may be a result of the misrepresentation or false information being spread about a group through the media, which is a problem because it can lead to conflict and violence as well as certain groups being discriminated against. The media creates a divide between groups, polarizing people and how they view each other. Our everyday lives and the interactions we have with others is heavily influenced by the media so it is crucial that all groups and individuals are represented fairly and truthfully. </p>

                <!-- About Section Content-->
                <div class="container"><p> On June 12, 2016, a mass tragedy occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Florida. An American-born man with parents who emigrated from Afghanistan carried out an attack that ended the lives of 49 people and injured 53 others. The attack was a hate crime against the LGBTQIA+  community but was then overlooked by theories of the attacker being linked to ISIS. No evidence supporting the ISIS theory was ever found but the media ran with the idea and many members of the public believed this to be true anyway. Rather than focusing on figuring out a motive, many assumed due to the attacker's ethnicity that he was linked to terrorist groups. This is only one of many examples of misinformation being spread due to the media presenting events or issues without fully fact-checking their information. This can lead to the public making assumptions about groups and individuals based on accounts of misinformation.
 Another example of the spread of misinformation is the September 11th terrorist attacks. According to the FBI’s uniform crime reporting program from 2001 “Anti-Islamic religion incidents were previously the second least reported, but in 2001, they became the second highest reported among religious-bias incidents… growing by more than 1,600 percent over the 2000 volume”. Although it was reported many did not focus on 9-11 being done by a terrorist group, the focus/blame was on a specific religion. The religion was focused on as a result of 9-11 causing hate crimes to spike as stated by the FBI’s uniformed crime report, it also caused other terrorist attacks to be linked to the Islamic religion despite lack of evidence or connection. This can be seen 15 years later in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, which demonstrates the importance of the media sharing factual data that leaves no details out and no room for false information. All it takes is one negative link to a group to permanently damage their image and the way the public interacts with them, as well as create false information that can be seen as fact to be spread about them in the future.
The Impacts of 9/11 can be seen not only in events of tragedies it can also be seen in everyday life. “Islamophobia in the U.S. has not gone away. There is more understanding about Islam, but Muslim Americans say they continue to face discrimination and questions about their national loyalty” (Mineo, Muslim Americans who endured post-9/11 bias see solutions in education, political involvement). Although education has happened to help prevent this discrimination, the damage has been done due to the media coverage during and right after the event.
In the year 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, repeatedly referred to the virus as the “Chinese virus” or the “kung-flu”, these negative comments helped to result in many violent hate crimes against those in the Asian community. The media portrayed the virus to have originated in Wuhan China, this piece of information helped aid people like Trump to blame those in the Asian community. This led to the misconception that China or other countries in Asia purposefully caused the pandemic. It is shown that the media linking a group through events or even stereotypes, like  Islam being a violent religion, causes many in the hegemonic group to negatively view individuals in those groups as well as potentially act upon those views in negative ways. 
Entertainment media has a similar effect when not seen as satire. One example of this while not involving race is the south park episode about redheads, which had discussions that became popular on social media sites such as youtube. An effect of this episode was many people with red hair were bullied and said to not have souls. A viral video was made about this episode of a kid explaining his bullying situation due to the episode. Shows like South park that are meant to be satire can be misinterpreted and taken seriously which can lead to individuals and groups being treated in a negative way. This demonstrates how easily influenced people are by the media, from topics ranging from hair color to politics to race. 
To state clearly, the media, be it news or entertainment can place stereotypes and spread misinformation that can negatively affect minority groups. This can lead to negative and dangerous acts that can create unfair opportunities, mental/ physically hurt, or even lead to the death of individuals of an affected group. It is easy to trust people and organizations in our universe of obligation, so you tend to trust misinformation coming from these trusted sources, which can lead to discrimination against minorities. In efforts to fix this, organizations such as the Representation Project and Black Public Media have been made to give more accurate media representation to minority groups. This helps to end the continuation of negative stereotypes that are constantly seen in the media while spreading accurate information on multiple different groups. Although there is still a need for news media to be held just as accountable as entertainment media this is a great step in the right direction. For the general public, steps that we can take to address this is to critically think about the media we are taking in and understand that not all of it is fact even when it may be stated as one. It is our responsibility to look into these facts to insure we are not believing stereotypes and misinformation. We could also support these organizations by watching their movies, or donating to financially support their cause.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Anti-Asian hate crimes rose in August 2020 which led to protests such as that pictured above. The verbal and physical attacks caused them to feel unwanted and unsafe in public places. As stated in COVID-19 Anti-Asian Racism and Race-Based Stress: A Phenomenological Qualitative Media Analysis there were more than 9,000 incidents that have happened or been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. Another thing stated was a physical incident that happened, where a man assaulted an Asian woman in New York on the subway. The man was “convinced” that she was infected with covid 19 and called her “diseased” and was cursing at her. He proceeded to kick and punch her in front of others. Another thing that has occurred is an increase in bullying in the classroom around the country. Asians have suffered from an increase in bullying since the pandemic began. This is the impact of the covid-19 news reports making an emphasis on Covid-19 being from China. Specifically, the reports blame Asian people as a whole.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Before watching the video, the content warning includes Islamophobia. Post-9/11 America can be an unfriendly and judgemental place for Arab Americans and Muslims all across the country. Nationwide Islamophobia was spread in wake of the September 11 attacks from domestic media that still persists today. One popular news outlet that still consistently spreads misinformation about Muslims is Fox News. Ex-host Jeanine Pirro was quoted on January 10th, 2015 on a nationwide broadcast saying: “We need to kill them. We need to kill them… Our job is to arm those Muslims to the teeth, give them everything they need to take out these Islamic fanatics, let them do the job, and when they do, we need to simply look the other way,”. Hate speech being spoken on a household-trusted news station makes Islamophobia seem okay for the general public to participate in, increasing inexcusable hate of the entire religion. Another example of blatant Islamophobia spread through the media is hate speech from former president Donald Trump. In the video above, taken at one of his 2015 presidential campaign rallies, Mr. Trump calls for a full banning of Muslims from entering the country. His statement was met with applause and cheering. Racism and xenophobia are baked into this country, with the media and its hateful messages only persisting and worsening them. Hate towards a group of people being mainstream further divides the nation, removing groups from our universe of obligation, alienating us from each other. </p>

Furthermore, white Americans with the most exaggerated misunderstandings of the racial composition of the poor are the most likely to oppose welfare”(page 3). Many people have the opinion, which some segments of the media encourage,  that most whites blame welfare recipients for their situation, and are less likely to support welfare than those with more accurate perceptions of poverty. Essentially, media and popular opinion intertwine to misrepresent poverty within the minority class.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Echo chambers strengthen the views and ideals of groups, often pushing such groups toward extremity. Echo chambers are quite common on social media, because of the nature of many platforms, grouping communities of people who have like-minded ideas together. Opinions on polarizing matters, most critically racism, are often pushed to an extreme because there is a lack of diverse experiences and viewpoints in these communities. In the United States, there has been an increase in these groups over recent years, especially racist extremist groups often sporting hateful imagery, like Confederate flags and Third Reich memorabilia. The culmination of these extremist groups was the very well-known January 6th, 2021 storming of the United States Capital by right-wing extremists (pictured above are the Proud Boys). This event was completely unacceptable and likely spurred by hate-fueled echo chambers that occurred on social media platforms. This is unfortunately something we will likely continue to see as social media platforms only increase in popularity.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">With protests big and small happening all over the country every day, the media can't cover them all. So it is no wonder that the ones the media chooses to cover can be quite sensationalized. Often this can lead to groups feeling strong emotional responses. A great example of how the media can sensationalize protests is to look at the 4 weeks of protests in Portland in 2020. At the start of the protests It made headlines and was the top story of major cable networks. By the end of the 4 weeks it had moved down to more of a footnote than a story. Networks tend to focus more on the few bad actors in protests rather than the actual message. This trend of focusing on the protest itself rather than the message they are trying to get across leads to strong emotional responses from groups watching the protests. Potentially causing counter protests and even more tension. It doesn't help that the media is significantly more likely to cover a riot than a peaceful protest which ironically enough can cause more riots because it is seen as the only way to get the nation's attention.
